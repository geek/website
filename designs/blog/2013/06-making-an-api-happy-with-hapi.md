[Hapi][] is a framework for rapidly building RESTful web services. Whether you
are building a very simple set of RESTful services or a large scale, cache
heavy, and secure set of services, [hapi][] has you covered.  [Hapi][] will
help get your server developed quickly with its wide range of configurable
options.

## Building a Products API

The following example will walk you through using hapi to build a RESTful set
of services for creating and listing out products. To get started create a
directory named _products_ and add a _package.json_ file to the directory
that looks like the following.

    {
        "name": "products",
        "version": "0.0.1",
        "engines": {
            "node": ">=0.10.0"
        },
        "peerDependencies": {
            "hapi": "1.x.x"
        }
    }

Create a _main.js_ file that will serve as the entry point for the plugin.  Add the following to the file:

    var Routes = require('./routes');

    exports.register = function (plugin, options, callback) {
        plugin.route(Routes);
    };

[Hapi][] provides a function for adding a single route or an array of routes.
In this example we are adding an array of routes from a routes module.

Go ahead and create a _routes.js_ file, which will contain the route
information and handlers. When defining the routes we will also be specifying
[validation requirements][]. 

For this example three routes will be created. Below is the code you should
use to add the routes. Add the following code to your _routes.js_ file.

    module.exports = function (plugin) {
        var types = plugin.hapi.types;
    
        return [
            { method: 'GET', path: '/products', config: { handler: getProducts, query: { name: types.string() } } },
            { method: 'GET', path: '/products/{id}', config: { handler: getProduct } },
            { method: 'POST', path: '/products', config: { handler: addProduct, payload: 'parse', schema: { name: types.string().required().min(3) }, response: { id: types.number().required() } } }
        ];
    };

The routes are exported as an array so that they can easily be included by the
plugin register function. For the products listing endpoint we are
allowing a querystring parameter for name. When this querystring parameter
exists then we will filter the products for those that have a matching name.

The second route is a very simple route that demonstrates how a parameter can
become part of the path definition. This route will return a product matching
the ID thatâ€™s requested.

In the last route, the one used for creating a product, you will notice that
extra validation requirements are added, even those on the response body. The
request body must contain a parameter for name that has a minimum of 3
characters and the response body must contain an ID to be validated.

Next add the handlers to the _routes.js_ file.

    function getProducts(request) {

        if (request.query.name) {
            request.reply(findProducts(request.query.name));
        }
        else {
            request.reply(products);
        }
    }

    function findProducts(name) {
        return products.filter(function(product) {
            return product.name.toLowerCase() === name.toLowerCase();
        });
    }

    function getProduct(request) {
        var product = products.filter(function(p) {
            return p.id == request.params.id;
        }).pop();

        request.reply(product);
    }

    function addProduct(request) {
        var product = {
            id: products[products.length - 1].id + 1,
            name: request.payload.name
        };

        products.push(product);

        request.reply.created('/products/' + product.id)({
            id: product.id
        });
    }

As you can see in the handlers, [hapi][] provides a simple way to add a
response body by using the _request.reply_ function. Also, in the instance
when you have created an item you can use the _request.reply.created_ function
to send a 201 response.

Lastly, add a simple array to contain the products that the service will serve.

    var products = [{
            id: 1,
            name: 'Guitar'
        },
        {
            id: 2,
            name: 'Banjo'
        }
    ];
    

## Composing the server

The plugin can now be added to a server using a `config.json` file.  Create a `config.json`
file outside of the plugin directory in a new directory you plan to run the server.  Add
the following contents to `config.json`

    {
        "servers": [
            {
                "host": "0.0.0.0",
                "port": 8080,
                "options": {
                    "labels": ["http", "api"]
                }
            }
        ],
        "plugins": {
            "products": {}
        }
    }

Next run `npm link` within the products folder and then run `npm link products` inside the folder where
the `config.json` exists.  After this you will want to also run `npm install -g hapi` to install hapi.

## Running the server

Start the hapi server using the following command:

    hapi -c config.json

To see a list of the products navigate to
<http://locahost:8080/products>. Below is a screenshot of what the response
looks like.

<img src="https://raw.github.com/wpreul/hapi-example/master/images/products.png" height="75px" width="auto" />

Go ahead and append `?name=banjo` to the URL to try searching for a product by
name.

<img src="https://raw.github.com/wpreul/hapi-example/master/images/banjo.png" height="75px" width="auto" />

Use curl or a REST console to create a product. Make a POST request to the
products endpoint with a name in the body. Using curl the command looks like:
`curl http://localhost:8080/products -d "name=test"`. Below is an example of
the response headers from making a request to create a product.

<img src="https://raw.github.com/wpreul/hapi-example/master/images/headers.png" height="225px" width="auto" />

Now if you navigate to the _Location_ specified in the response headers you
should see the product that you created.

## Other features

There are a lot of different configuration features that you can add to the
server.  The extensive list can be found in the readme at
<http://hapijs.com>.

The built-in cache support has providers for mongo and redis. Setting up cache
is as simple as passing cache: true as part of the server configuration.

Additionally, there are several configuration options available on a per route
basis. For example, caching expiration times can also be configured on a per route basis. Also,
you can have per-route authentication settings.

## Conclusion

By now you should have a decent understanding of what hapi has to offer.
There are still many other features and options available to you when using
hapi that is covered in the documentation.  Please take a look at the
[github repository][] and feel free to provide any feedback you may have.
